Well, I'm back from the termite wars, so now I can try to explain the
mathematics behind the 'randsphere' function. (Note: I should have
written an explanation along these lines to accompany 'randsphere' when I
first placed it in the File Exchange. Perhaps your query will get me
going on remedying that deficit.)

In the first line of 'randsphere' we have

X = randn(m,n)

which produces m rows, each consisting of n independent, normally
distributed random variables, mean 0, variance 1. For the purposes of
this discussion, assume that m equals 1 so that we would be talking about
a single set of n values.

By definition, the sum of the squares, s2, in

s2 = sum(X^2)

gives a value with the chi-squared distribution with n degrees of
freedom. If you look at Steven Wolfram's MathWorld website at

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chi-SquaredDistribution.html,

you can see in its equation (6) that the cumulative probability
distribution for such a chi-squared distribution is:

Prob(s2 <= c^2) = incomplete_gamma(n/2,c^2/2) / gamma(n/2)

However, matlab's incomplete gamma function, 'gammainc', has been
regularized by division with gamma(n/2) and its arguments reversed in
order from this, so we have

Prob(s2 <= c^2) = gammainc(c^2/2,n/2)

with matlab's 'gamminc' function. This is the probability that the vector
X will fall in a hypersphere of radius less than or equal to c. Note that
fortunately this depends only on the radius c and not on the direction of
X.

On the other hand, the n-dimensional volume of a hypersphere of radius s
<= r is proportional to s^n so it occupies the fraction, (s/r)^n, of the
whole desired hypersphere in 'randsphere', r being its specified radius.

The strategy in 'randsphere' then is to map the original X value so that
it remains along the same ray but with a radius altered from c to s, in
such a way that the fraction of volume of the hypersphere with radius s of
the whole hypersphere will be equal to the probability of having had any
original X within the hypersphere of radius c. This would then provide
the hypersphere with a uniform distribution. That is, the probability of
mapping into the hypersphere of radius s would be proportional to its
volume, which is what we need.

This leads to the equality

gammainc(c^2/2,n/2) = (s/r)^n (Matlab's 'gammainc')

or

s = r*(gammainc(c^2/2,n/2))^(1/n)

which provides the necessary mapping relationship between c (=sqrt(s2)) and s.

The unit vector along the ray is X/sqrt(s2), so we multiply

X/sqrt(s2)*r*(gammainc(s2^2/2,n/2))^(1/n)

to obtain the transformed vector that lies within the desired
hypersphere. This (hopefully) explains the third and last line in the
code for 'randsphere'.

Confession: As it happened, back in December when this problem was being
considered I had never noticed the 'gammainc' function in matlab. While
trying to produce a uniform distribution for a hypersphere, after some
furious analysis, I arrived at the point where I realized the need for an
incomplete form of the gamma function and wondered how in the world it
could ever be computed. This led me to rereading the description of
matlab's gamma function in my manual and lo and behold there was the
lovely 'gammainc' function in the same section staring me in the face,
just waiting to be used. My face was a little red at the time!
